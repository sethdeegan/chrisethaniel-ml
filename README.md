Chistopher Wang, Seth Deegan, and Daniel Wu's Machine Learning Mini Unit Repo

## Installation
Dependencies: tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib

## Description
For our Mini Unit Lab, we followed this tutorial to learn how to train a model to classify images of clothing:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification

quickstart.py is just a python file that we used to test if tensorflow was correctly downloaded.
classification.py is our clothing classification program.
Our model's test accuracy is 87%.
Several pngs were also added to the repo for any plots, graphs, or images generated by the gui.

Some sections of the code were commented out to indicate that they are not part of the main loading data/training model/testing model process.

Since tensorflow is a module that takes up a lot of space, since some of us had a harder time installing the dependencies (bc of chromebook limitations, problems with pip, etc), and since all 3 of us needed a way to be on 1 python file at the same time, we decided to only have 1 person (Daniel Wu) install all of the dependencies, handle the commits, and set up a liveshare instead of having all 3 of us setting up a seperate branch and making our own commits.
